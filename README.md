## GAN-Data-Matching

This repo is dedicated to a project surrounding matching synthetic data to the real data it was generated from.
The matching works by calculating distance and then predicting the closest partners by using a ranking system.
From there, visualizations are created to show how similar the data can be.
This is created to increase the diversity of the data generated and help with protecting patient privacy during data generation.
We want to make sure that the data we generate when using patients does not have any identifiable characteristics of any specific individuals.

This was a research project done under the Digital Health Innovation Lab at BCCHR. This illustrates my work done for the team.
